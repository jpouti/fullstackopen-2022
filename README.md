# [Full Stack open 2022](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

This course focuses on modern web application development with JavaScript, building single page applications with ReactJS and REST APIs built with Node.js. This course also covers a modern alternative to REST APIs, GraphQL. As well as testing, configuration and environment management. MongoDB is mainly used for storing the application's data, however one section is covering relational databases and PostgreSQL.
